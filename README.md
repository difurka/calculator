# Calculator (exercise from Hyperskill)

 The program should read an unlimited sequence of numbers from the standard input and calculate their sum. 
 Also, add a /help command to print some information about the program. If you encounter an empty line, do not output anything. program should support for multiplication *, integer division / and parentheses (...). They have a higher priority than addition + and subtraction -. Do not forget about variables; they, and the unary minus operator, should still work. Modify the result of the /help command to explain all possible operators.
